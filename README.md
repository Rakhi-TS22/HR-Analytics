**HR Analysis Repository Description**

This repository hosts data and analysis related to Human Resources (HR) tasks. The dataset provided contains information about employee performance and various attributes such as satisfactory level, last evaluation, number of projects, average monthly hours, etc. The analysis aims to delve into employee behavior, identify factors influencing employee retention, and potentially predict employee attrition.

**Contents:**

1. **Data:** Contains the raw dataset (`people.csv`) used for analysis.

  2. **Analysis Notebook:** The Jupyter notebook (`HR_Analysis.ipynb`) contains the code for exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and generating insights from the HR dataset.

**Analysis Overview:**

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigates the distribution, relationships, and summary statistics of various HR attributes.
  
- **Predictive Modeling:** Utilizes machine learning techniques to forecast employee attrition and identify key predictors influencing retention.
